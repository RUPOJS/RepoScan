Each component\ninstance references the DOM node via its `node` property.\n- Component instances cannot be referenced directly; they communicate with other components via events.\n\n### Interacting with the DOM\n\nOnce attached, component instances have direct access to their node object via the `node` property.

The Component prototype supplies methods for triggering events as\nwell as for subscribing to and unsubscribing from events. These Component event methods are actually just convenient\nwrappers around regular event methods on DOM nodes.\n\n### Mixins ([API](doc/mixin_api.md))\n\n- In Flight, a mixin is a function which assigns properties to a target object (represented by the `this`\nkeyword).\n- A typical mixin defines a set of functionality that will be useful to more than one component.\n- One mixin can be applied to any number of [Component](#components) definitions.\n- One Component definition can have any number of mixins applied to it.\n- Each Component defines a [*core*](#core_mixin) mixin within its own module.\n- A mixin can itself have mixins applied to it.\n\n### Advice ([API](doc/advice_api.md))\n\nIn Flight, advice is a mixin (`'lib/advice.js'`) that defines `before`, `after` and `around` methods.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/rupeshsingh/langChain/RepoScan/temp-repos/repo-1745227904299/README.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":147,"to":165}},"filePath":"README.md","complexity":3,"antiPatterns":[],"authors":["Andrew Lunny"]}}],["25",{"pageContent":"These can be used to modify existing functions by adding custom code. All Components have advice mixed in to\ntheir prototype so that mixins can augment existing functions without requiring knowledge\nof the original implementation. Moreover, since Components are seeded with an empty `initialize` method,\nComponent definitions will typically use `after` to define custom `initialize` behavior.\n\n### Debugging ([API](doc/debug_api.md))\n\nFlight ships with a debug module which can help you trace the sequence of event triggering and binding. By default\nconsole logging is turned off, but you can log `trigger`, `on` and `off` events by means of the following console\ncommands.\n\n## Authors\n\n+ [@angus-c](http://github.com/angus-c)\n+ [@danwrong](http://github.com/danwrong)\n+ [@kpk](http://github.com/kennethkufluk)","metadata":{"source":"/Users/rupeshsingh/langChain/RepoScan/temp-repos/repo-1745227904299/README.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":167,"to":182}},"filePath":"README.md","complexity":1,"antiPatterns":[],"authors":["Andrew Lunny"]}}],["26",{"pageContent":"Thanks for assistance and contributions:\n[@sayrer](https://github.com/sayrer),\n[@shinypb](https://github.com/shinypb),\n[@kloots](https://github.com/kloots),\n[@marcelduran](https://github.com/marcelduran),\n[@tbrd](https://github.com/tbrd),\n[@necolas](https://github.com/necolas),\n[@fat](https://github.com/fat),\n[@mkuklis](https://github.com/mkuklis),\n[@jrburke](https://github.com/jrburke),\n[@garann](https://github.com/garann),\n[@WebReflection](https://github.com/WebReflection),\n[@coldhead](https://github.com/coldhead),\n[@paulirish](https://github.com/paulirish),\n[@nimbupani](https://github.com/nimbupani),\n[@mootcycle](https://github.com/mootcycle).\n\nSpecial thanks to the rest of the Twitter web team for their abundant\ncontributions and feedback.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2013 Twitter, Inc and other contributors.\n\nLicensed under the MIT License","metadata":{"source":"/Users/rupeshsingh/langChain/RepoScan/temp-repos/repo-1745227904299/README.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":184,"to":208}},"filePath":"README.md","complexity":3,"antiPatterns":[],"authors":["Andrew Lunny"]}}],["27",{"pageContent":"{\n  \"name\": \"flight\",\n  \"description\": \"Clientside component infrastructure\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"version\": \"1.5.1\",\n  \"ignore\": [\n    \".*\",\n    \"doc\",\n    \"test\",\n    \"CHANGELOG.md\",\n    \"CONTRIBUTING.md\",\n    \"Makefile\",\n    \"karma.conf.js\",\n    \"package.json\",\n    \"webpack.conf.js\"\n  ],\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"jquery\": \">=1.8.0\"\n  }\n}","metadata":{"source":"/Users/rupeshsingh/langChain/RepoScan/temp-repos/repo-1745227904299/bower.json","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":20}},"filePath":"bower.json","complexity":1,"antiPatterns":[],"authors":["Andrew Lunny"]}}],["28",{"pageContent":"# Flight API documentation","metadata":{"source":"/Users/rupeshsingh/langChain/RepoScan/temp-repos/repo-1745227904299/doc/README.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}},"filePath":"doc/README.md","complexity":1,"antiPatterns":[],"authors":["Andrew Lunny"]}}],["29",{"pageContent":"* [Advice API](advice_api.md)\n  * [this.before](advice_api.md#this.before)\n  * [this.after](advice_api.md#this.after)\n  * [this.around](advice_api.md#this.around)\n  * [flight.advice.withAdvice](advice_api.md#advice.withAdvice)\n* [Base API](base_api.md)\n  * [this.attributes](base_api.md#this.attributes)\n  * [this.select](base_api.md#this.select)\n  * [this.initialize](base_api.md#this.initialize)\n  * [this.on](base_api.md#this.on)\n  * [this.off](base_api.md#this.off)\n  * [this.trigger](base_api.md#this.trigger)\n  * [this.teardown](base_api.md#this.teardown)\n* [Component API](component_api.md)\n  * [flight.component](component_api.md#defineComponent)\n  * [flight.component.teardownAll](component_api.md#defineComponent.teardownAll)\n  * [Component.attachTo](component_api.md#Component.attachTo)\n  * [Component.teardownAll](component_api.md#Component.teardownAll)\n* [Debug API](debug_api.md)\n* [Mixin API](mixin_api.md)\n* [Utilities API](utils_api.md)\n  * [compose](utils_api.md#utils.compose)","metadata":{"source":"/Users/rupeshsingh/langChain/RepoScan/temp-repos/repo-1745227904299/doc/README.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":3,"to":24}},"filePath":"doc/README.md","complexity":1,"antiPatterns":[],"authors":["Andrew Lunny"]}}],["30",{"pageContent":"* [Utilities API](utils_api.md)\n  * [compose](utils_api.md#utils.compose)\n  * [countThen](utils_api.md#utils.countThen)\n  * [debounce](utils_api.md#utils.debounce)\n  * [delegate](utils_api.md#utils.delegate)\n  * [isDomObj](utils_api.md#utils.isDomObj)\n  * [isEnumerable](utils_api.md#utils.isEnumerable)\n  * [merge](utils_api.md#utils.merge)\n  * [push](utils_api.md#utils.push)\n  * [throttle](utils_api.md#utils.throttle)\n  * [toArray](utils_api.md#utils.toArray)\n  * [uniqueArray](utils_api.md#utils.uniqueArray)","metadata":{"source":"/Users/rupeshsingh/langChain/RepoScan/temp-repos/repo-1745227904299/doc/README.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":23,"to":34}},"filePath":"doc/README.md","complexity":1,"antiPatterns":[],"authors":["Andrew Lunny"]}}],["31",{"pageContent":"# Advice API\n\nIn Flight, `advice` is a mixin (`lib/advice.js`) that defines `before`, `after`\nand `around` methods.\n\nThese can be used to modify existing functions by adding custom code.
